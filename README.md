# InsuranceAI

This project is a proof of concept for an intelligent insurance agent.

The agent can:
- Classify insurance documents
- Take appropriate actions based on document type
- Generate relevant responses

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies via uv
```bash
uv sync
```
3. Run the [demo notebook](src/insurance_doc_classification.ipynb)

* Note that the model is in `.gitignore` so it won't be checked into the repo. It is very quick to train a new model, so you can just run the notebook to get a new one.
